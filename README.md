To differentiate project finance privatization from management contracts and draw a comparative table, we will outline several criteria. Here's how the table would be structured based on these criteria:

| Criteria | Project Finance Privatization | Management Contract |
|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| Investment | Substantial initial investment in infrastructure by the private sector. | Minimal or no investment by the management company; the infrastructure remains funded by the owner. |
| Financial Risk | Private investor bears the financial risk of construction and operation. | Management company assumes limited financial risk related to the operational tasks they oversee. |
| Operational Control | Private investor has extensive control over day-to-day operations as well as strategic decisions. | Management company has operational control but strategic decisions remain with the airport owner. |
| Revenue Source | Revenue is mainly generated from airport operations such as user fees, leases, and concessions. | Revenue for the management company comes from fees paid by the airport owner for the services provided. |
| Duration | Long-term arrangement typically lasting several decades. | Shorter-term agreement, spanning several years rather than decades. |
| Ownership | Ownership of the airport typically remains with the public sector; private sector leases and operates facilities. | Ownership remains with the airport owner, and the management company is contracted for services only. |
| Responsibility for Upgrades and Expansion | Typically, the private sector is responsible for capital improvements and expansions during the concession. | Airport owner is usually responsible for major capital improvements and expansion projects. |
| Profit's Dependency | Profits are highly dependent on the performance and traffic of the airport. | Profits are dependent on performance to an extent but are generally guaranteed through the fixed or performance-based management fee. |
| Exit Strategy | Exit strategies can be complex due to significant investment and contractual obligations. | Exit strategies are simpler and generally involve finding a new management company or reverting management to the owner. |
| Goal Alignment | Aligns the private sector's goal of profitability with the efficiency and quality of the airport's operation. | Focuses on operational efficiency and may include performance targets tied to the management fee. |

This table summarizes the key differences between project finance privatization and management contracts based on various criteria important for the management and operation of airports.
